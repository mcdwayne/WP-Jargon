# WP-Jargon
The GIthub version of the WordPress Jargon Glossary page

Meant to be a simpler way to coordinate the evolution of the Jargon page and PDF

the markdown file (.md) is translated through https://www.browserling.com/tools/markdown-to-html to make the html page, which is also populated to the index.html which populates[the github pages](https://mcdwayne.github.io/WP-Jargon/)
